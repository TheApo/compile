Selecting / Targeting Cards for Effects
By default, only uncovered cards on either player's side of the field can be selected as the
target of a flip, delete, return, shift, or reveal (e.g. "Flip 1 card." can be understood as "Flip 1
uncovered card.").
Unless otherwise specified, your cards or your opponent's card can both be selected (e.g.
"Flip 1 card." can target your uncovered cards or your opponent's uncovered cards but "Flip
1 of your cards." can only target yours).
Covered cards can be chosen by text that uses "covered" or "all" (e.g. "Flip 1 covered card."
or "Delete all cards in a line").
If text uses "this card" or "that card", then no selection is necessary and the card referred
to, regardless of being covered or uncovered, can be manipulated (e.g. "Flip 1 card. Shift
that card to this line." The flip would follow the normal targeting rules. Then the shift can
manipulate the card regardless of whether it has been covered since.)
